Hello there, thankyou for using this program!
When using the program, it doesn't matter about capital letters,
but you will have to have word perfect answers. I would reccomend
copy and pasting the commands from this command list into the
program but it is up to you. Here are the commands:

Wifi Password
Creator
Favourite Website
Favourite Drink
Favourite Word
Favourite Food
Monster Drink Flavours
Favourite Thing To Do
Test 001
Repeat
Favourite Parent
Chicken
Fast Food

There is a secret input can you guess it? It is an 3rror!
